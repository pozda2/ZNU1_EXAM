    "Diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic life threatening diseases that have already affected 422 million people worldwide according to the report of World Health Organization (WHO), in 2018. Due to the presence of a relatively long asymptomatic phase, early detection of diabetes is always desired for a clinically meaningful outcome. Around 50% of all people suffering from diabetes are undiagnosed because of its long-term asymptomatic phase.\n",
