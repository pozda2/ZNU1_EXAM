    "# Chocolate Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "Chocolate is paramount in our society, it is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE) and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first solid chocolate bar put into production was made by J. S. Fry & Sons of Bristol, England in 1847 and today it is estimated to be an USD 130.56 billion dollar industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of all of this, this dataset contains reviews on more than 2400 different chocolate bars along with metadata and information on US and Canadian based producers. "
