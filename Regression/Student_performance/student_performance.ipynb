    "\n",
    "Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd-period grades. \n",
    "It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful."
